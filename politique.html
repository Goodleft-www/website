    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Goodleft application (registered address).
        Goodleft's mission is to promote everyone's commitment to fighting food waste by offering individuals the opportunity to rescue unsold products from food stores at closing time.
        We offer the user ("User" or "you") the opportunity to choose from "Surprise Baskets" containing food products or other perishable goods ("Products"). The Products are unsold and unidentified. They are offered for "Reservation" by food stores, restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, hotels, gas stations, etc. ("Merchants") on our Platform (the "Service").
        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") apply to any Reservation of Products that you make through our websites or applications ("Platform").
        By making a Reservation (as defined below), you agree to these Terms. You are therefore required to read them carefully before making a Reservation on the Platform.
        Goodleft's privacy and cookie policy, available at any time on the Platform, is an integral part of these Terms and will be automatically accepted upon acceptance of these terms.</p>
    <!-- 2 -->
    <h2>2. THE GOODLEFT CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>The Surprise Baskets presented on the Platform may be Reserved by the User under the conditions defined below.
        Once the Reservation is received and accepted by the Merchant, we send the User a Reservation Confirmation under the conditions defined below.
        Once the Reservation is made and accepted, the User is required to present themselves to the Merchant at the Collection time (as defined below) and the Merchant undertakes to offer them the Surprise Basket for sale. Both parties have a right of cancellation under the conditions established below.
        We merely organize the Reservation of Surprise Baskets through the Platform on behalf of the Merchants. No contractual relationship is formed between Goodleft and the User when Reserving Products, or later when they are sold. Goodleft is not responsible for the Products or for compliance with any agreement formed between the Merchant and the User.
        Goodleft collects the Purchase Price of the Products on behalf of the Merchant (under the conditions defined below) and as such only acts as an agent of the Merchant for payment.
        </p>
    <!-- 3 -->

    <h2>5. PRODUCT AND PRODUCT INFORMATION
    </h2>
    <p>Goodleft simply connects Users with Businesses in order to form Reservations. Goodleft is not responsible for the Products or for compliance with any agreement formed between the Business and the User.
        Goodleft does not manufacture, make, sell, purchase, store, prepare, produce, process, brand, package, deliver or handle the Products. Goodleft cannot be held responsible for compliance with the contractual or legal obligations incumbent on the Business towards the User, in particular concerning the Products, including their manufacture, sale, purchase, warehouse, preparation, production, transformation, marking, delivery, their quality, ingredients, allergens or their handling, except in the case where Goodleft is explicitly designated as the manufacturer or seller of a Product on the Platform.
        The User can find information about the Products and a description of the Products on the Platform. As the exact nature of the Products presented on the Platform is not defined, the information does not allow us to know their composition. The information is only provided with the aim of giving the User the best conditions to evaluate the Products before Reserving them. The description may not be up to date and the range of Products, items in stock, etc. may not be correct. does not conform to it. Goodleft cannot be held responsible for such inadequacy of information. It is the Businesses who are responsible for providing information on the Products and ensuring that it is accurate and up to date. Goodleft is therefore also not responsible for the content or availability of information relating to the Products.
        If there is any doubt regarding allergens, the content of a dish or any other information on the menu, the User must contact the Business directly before making a Reservation. The Commerce’s contact details will appear on the Platform.
        During Collection (as defined below), the Business must provide the User with information relating to the list of ingredients, allergens or the Product labeling. All Products Reserved through the Platform and purchased at the time of Collection must be consumed immediately after Collection and/or according to the instructions on the Product label or provided by the Business. Goodleft will not assume any responsibility for the adverse effects of the Products for any reason whatsoever, including in the event of consumption not in accordance with the labeling or the information provided directly by the Store.
        Goodleft cannot be held responsible for any failure or delay in the execution of any obligation relating to the Products, including with regard to their manufacture, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, transformation, marking, delivery, their quality, ingredients, allergens or handling.</p>
    <!-- 6 -->
    <h2>6. RESERVATION OF PRODUCTS    </h2>
    <p>A list of Businesses can be found on the Platform when the User has provided an address or authorized their geolocation. The list displays the Businesses near this location in order of their proximity, starting with the closest. Once the User has selected the Business and the Product, he will have the possibility to place his Reservation by clicking on "Order", "Reserve" or a similar button.
        The list is established solely based on this geographic criterion. The User also has the possibility of filtering the results according to the availability of Surprise Baskets to Reserve, the Collection time or the nature of the Products contained in the Surprise Baskets (meals, sweets, groceries or special diet). Goodleft reserves the right to change these filter criteria.
        The Businesses referenced are those which are active on the Platform.
        The presentation of Products on the Platform is a simple invitation to make a Reservation intended for Users.</p>
    <!-- 7 -->
    <h2>7. BOOKING CONFIRMATION </h2>
    <p>Upon receipt of the Reservation, Goodleft transmits it to the associated Business. Goodleft informs the User of the sending of the Reservation (“Reservation Confirmation”).
        The User must keep the Reservation Confirmation, containing details of their Reservation.
        By making a Reservation, the User undertakes to go to the Store at the Collection time. In return, the Business undertakes to present the Product for purchase.
        If the User fails to appear at the Store at the time of Collection and does not cancel in accordance with the conditions set out, the amount of the Product will be debited. No refund will be possible.</p>

    <!-- 8 -->
    <h2>8. RIGHT OF CANCELLATION    </h2>
    <p>Goodleft's mission is to prevent food waste and that of other perishable products. Therefore, if the Business anticipates that it will not have any unsold Products, it may cancel the Reservation up to two hours before the agreed Collection time. In this case, the User receives a cancellation notification from Goodleft or the Business by e-mail and/or SMS/and/or notification provided that the contact details provided to Goodleft are accurate and that the Customer has agreed to receive such notifications.
        Since the Products are perishable goods and the concept of Goodleft is to avoid their waste, the User can only cancel the Reservation up to two hours before the start of the Collection time.
        The User must communicate to Goodleft their decision to use their right of cancellation via the complaints link on the Platform. If the User cancels the Reservation outside the conditions stipulated in this clause, he will not be able to claim a refund.</p>
    <!-- 9 -->
    <h2>9. COLLECTION    </h2>
    <p>The Products Reserved on the Platform must be collected by the User at the address of the Business indicated on the Platform by the Business. The Collection time is indicated on the Platform, it is normally within a period of 10 to 30 minutes, but it may vary. The description of the Business and details of when and where the Products can be collected will appear on the Platform and are also indicated in the Booking Confirmation. If the User arrives at the Collection address before the specified Collection time, we ask them to wait outside for the good of the Commerce's customers. If the User shows up too late, the Business may be closed and/or the Product may be unavailable.
        Given that the Products are perishable goods and that the concept of Goodleft is to avoid their waste, the Business has the right to sell the Product to another customer if the User does not come and collect it within the time limit provided in the Reservation confirmation. In this case, Goodleft is still entitled to invoice the Purchase Price to the User.
        During Collection, the User must present their Reservation Confirmation present in the Goodleft application to the Commerce employees. They will validate the receipt and return the reserved Products. It is the User's responsibility to ensure that the Booking Confirmation in the application can be displayed at the time of collection. The User is required to ensure that the Products and the number of Products distributed correspond to their Reservation</p>
    <!-- 10 -->
    <h2>10. PRICE  </h2>
    <p>All prices are quoted in the currency of the country in which the Business is located and include applicable VAT, but may exclude any online payment administration fees unless otherwise stated.
        All costs related to the Reservation and payment will be calculated and indicated to the User at the time they make their Reservation.</p>
    <!-- 11 -->
    <h2>11. PAYMENT    </h2>
    <p>Payment can be made with a credit or debit card accepted by our partners or by any payment method made available on the Platform.
        If using a credit or debit card, the User must enter their card number, expiry date and security code when making a Reservation.
        The Purchase Price stipulated by the Business is debited from the User's Account when Reserving the Product or immediately after Collection (depending on the payment method chosen). If the Reservation is canceled in accordance with these Conditions, the Purchase Price will be canceled or refunded.
        The Purchase Price is collected by Goodleft from the User on behalf of the Business. Goodleft may modify or restructure the payment procedure of its Users, if it deems it reasonable.
        ——————————————————      
        The Platform uses PCI compliant payment service providers. Payment by debit or credit card on the Platform is secure and certified by the card issuer. All payments are made over an encrypted internet connection.

        If the User's credit card or payment method is refused when paying for an order, the User must verify that the information entered is correct.
        If the User has corrected the error and the credit card is still refused, Goodleft recommends that they contact their bank.
        Due to normal banking procedures, once the User has submitted a Booking using a credit or debit card and payment has been authorized, the bank or card issuer will reserve the full amount of the command. If the Booking is subsequently rejected by the Business or canceled for any other reason in accordance with these Conditions, the bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for this Booking to Goodleft and will reimburse the User for the corresponding amount by remitting it in its available balance. However, this operation may take up to 10 business days (or more, depending on the User's bank or card issuer). Goodleft does not have the authority to obtain information from the bank or the issuer of the User's card on the progress of this operation or on any specific payment-related questions. The User must contact their bank or card issuer to obtain this information.
